# Express Project Skeleton

Use this project skeleton as a starting point for structuring your app. Things to note
* Sequelize configuration has not yet been added -- you will need to set that up yourself
* You may find yourself wanting to use javascript -- js files can be added in `public/javascripts` and should be appended to the Pug templates as needed
* CSS files can go in `public/stylesheets` and also will need to be added to Pug templates

Code Highlights / Challenges
Highlights
These code shows how to correctly determine the join condition between parent/child tables when having multiple foreign keys that are referencing the same table. In this case, the Post model below have two foreign keys user_id and wall_id that are pointing to the users.id in the User model. By explicitly adding foreign_keys argument on both relationships will help SQLAlchemy know how to handle these conditions and not throw an AmbiguousForeignKeysError.
app/models/user.py

post_sender = db.relationship(
    'Post',
    back_populates='post_user_id',
    foreign_keys=Post.user_id,
    cascade='all, delete-orphan'
)

post_receiver = db.relationship(
    'Post',
    back_populates='post_wall_id',
    foreign_keys=Post.wall_id,
    cascade='all, delete-orphan'
)
app/models/post.py

user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('users.id'), nullable=False)
wall_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('users.id'), nullable=False)

post_user_id = db.relationship(
    'User',
    back_populates='post_sender',
    foreign_keys=user_id
)

post_wall_id = db.relationship(
    'User',
    back_populates='post_receiver',
    foreign_keys=wall_id
)
When a user activates the search bar, the search dropdown will show. Based on the search input values, the handleSearch() function is invoked when an onChange() event occurs. It uses .filter() to iterate through the channels and dynamically displays and returns what matches the search input value. When a user clicks on the search result, they will be redirected to the user profile.
react-app/src/components/NavBar.js

const handleSearch = (e) => {
    if (e.target.value === "") {
      setSearchInput("");
      setSearchResults([]);
    };

    if (e.target.value.length > 0) { 
      let filteredResults = Object.values(users).filter(user => 
        user['firstname']?.toLowerCase().includes(e.target.value.toLowerCase())
        || user['lastname']?.toLowerCase().includes(e.target.value.toLowerCase())
      );
      setSearchInput(e.target.value);
      setSearchResults(filteredResults);
    };
  };
Challenges
My biggest challenge was getting an AmbiguousForeignKeysError by not setting the proper foreign key relationship between User and Post models. In the Post model, I have two foreign keys user_id and wall_id that are both referencing the users.id in the User model. After parsing through SQLAlchemy documentation, I was able to setup the proper relationship by explicitly adding foreign_keys argument on both models and correctly determined the join condition between parent/child tables. See code snippet above.
